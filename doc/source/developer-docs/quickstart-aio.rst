Quick Start
===========

All-in-one (AIO) builds are a great way to perform an OpenStack-Ansible build
for:

* a development environment
* an overview of how all of the OpenStack services fit together
* a simple lab deployment

Although AIO builds aren't recommended for large production deployments,
they're great for smaller proof-of-concept deployments.

It's strongly recommended to have hardware that meets the following
requirements before starting an AIO build:

* CPU/motherboard that supports `hardware-assisted virtualization`_
* At least 80GB disk space (more than 175GB if you have a lxc lvm volume group)
* 16GB RAM

It's `possible` to perform AIO builds within a virtual machine but your
virtual machines will perform poorly.

.. _hardware-assisted virtualization: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization

Running an AIO build in one step
--------------------------------

For a one-step build, there is a `convenient script`_ within the
openstack-ansible repository that will run a AIO build with defaults:

.. _convenient script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/liberty/scripts/run-aio-build.sh

   .. code-block:: bash

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/liberty/scripts/run-aio-build.sh | sudo bash

It's advised to run this build within a terminal muxer, like tmux or screen,
so that you don't lose your progress if you're disconnected from your terminal
session.

Running a customized AIO build
------------------------------

There are four main steps for running a customized AIO build:

* Configuration *(this step is optional)*
* Initial host bootstrap
* Install and bootstrap Ansible
* Run playbooks

Start by cloning the openstack-ansible repository and changing into the
repository root directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible \
           /opt/openstack-ansible
       $ cd /opt/openstack-ansible

Next switch the the applicable branch/tag you wish to deploy from. Note that
deploying from the head of a branch may result in an unstable build due to
changes in flight and upstream OpenStack changes. For a test (ie not a
development) build it is usually best to checkout the latest tagged version.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ # List all existing tags.
       $ git tag -l

       $ # Checkout the latest tag from the previous command.
       $ git checkout 12.0.1

By default the scripts deploy all OpenStack services. At this point you may
optionally adjust which services are deployed within your AIO build.  Look at
the ``DEPLOY_`` environment variables at the top of
``scripts/run-playbooks.sh`` for more details. For example, if you'd like to
skip the deployment of ceilometer, you would execute the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ export DEPLOY_CEILOMETER="no"

Note that the scripts still build containers for any service that you disable,
but do not deploy the service.

In order for all the services to run, the host must be prepared with the
appropriate disks, packages, network configuration and a base configuration
for the OpenStack Deployment. This preparation is completed by executing:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ scripts/bootstrap-aio.sh

If you wish to add any additional configuration entries for the OpenStack
configuration then this can be done now by editing
``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``. Please see the `Install Guide`_
for more details.

Note that the host bootstrap is not idempotent and should only be executed
once.

Once you're ready to deploy, bootstrap Ansible by executing:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh

Finally, run the playbooks by executing:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ scripts/run-playbooks.sh

The installation process will take a while to complete, but here are some
general estimates:

* Bare metal systems with SSD storage: ~ 30-50 minutes
* Virtual machines with SSD storage: ~ 45-60 minutes
* Systems with traditional hard disks: ~ 90-120 minutes

Once the playbooks have fully executed, you may experiment with various
settings changes in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`` and only
run individual playbooks. For example, to run the playbook for the
Keystone service, execute:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cd /opt/openstack-ansible/playbooks
       $ openstack-ansible os-keystone-install.yml

.. _Install Guide: ../install-guide/

Rebuilding the AIO
------------------
Sometimes it may be useful to destroy all the containers and rebuild the AIO.
While it is preferred that the AIO is entirely destroyed and rebuilt, this
isn't always practical. As such the following may be executed instead:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ # Move to the playbooks directory.
       $ cd /opt/openstack-ansible/playbooks

       $ # Destroy all of the running containers.
       $ openstack-ansible lxc-containers-destroy.yml

       $ # On the host stop all of the services that run locally and not
       $ #  within a container.
       $ for i in \
              $(ls /etc/init \
                | grep -e "nova\|swift\|neutron" \
                | awk -F'.' '{print $1}'); do \
           service $i stop; \
         done

       $ # Uninstall the core services that were installed.
       $ for i in $(pip freeze | grep -e "nova\|neutron\|keystone\|swift"); do \
           pip uninstall -y $i; done

       $ # Remove crusty directories.
       $ rm -rf /openstack /etc/{neutron,nova,swift} \
                /var/log/{neutron,nova,swift}

There is a convenience script (``scripts/teardown.sh``) which will destroy
everything known within an environment. You should be aware that this script
will destroy whole environments and should be used WITH CAUTION.

After the teardown is complete, ``run-playbooks.sh`` may be executed again to
rebuild the AIO.

AIO Host Bootstrap Customisation
--------------------------------
The AIO makes a number of assumptions about the system it is being deployed
on. Many of these assumptions may be changed through the use of environment
variables which can be changed prior to the AIO host bootstrap.

As these options change on a regular basis it is best to examine each of the
scripts used to find the environment variables which can be overridden:

  * ``scripts/bootstrap-aio.sh`` (this sets the AIO host up)
  * ``scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh`` (this sets Ansible up)
  * ``scripts/scripts-library.sh`` (this is used by all the other scripts)

As an example, if you wish the Keystone Admin password to be a value which
you set (rather than the default of a random string), then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    export ADMIN_PASSWORD="secrete"

More details about the scripts used can be found in the `scripts page`_.

.. _scripts page: scripts.html

Quick AIO build on Rackspace Cloud
----------------------------------

You can automate the AIO build process with a virtual machine from the
Rackspace Cloud.

First, we will need a cloud-config file that will allow us to run the build as
soon as the instance starts.  Save this file as ``user_data.yml``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

    #cloud-config
    apt_mirror: http://mirror.rackspace.com/ubuntu/
    package_upgrade: true
    packages:
      - git-core
    runcmd:
      - export ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true
      - export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
      - export REPO=https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible
      - export BRANCH=liberty
      - git clone -b ${BRANCH} ${REPO} /opt/openstack-ansible
      - export DEPLOY_CEILOMETER="no"
      - cd /opt/openstack-ansible && scripts/bootstrap-aio.sh
      - cd /opt/openstack-ansible && scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh
      - cd /opt/openstack-ansible && scripts/run-playbooks.sh
    output: { all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' }

Feel free to customize the YAML file to meet your requirements.  As an example
above, the deployment of ceilometer will be skipped due to the
``DEPLOY_CEILOMETER`` export line.

We can pass this YAML file to nova and build a Cloud Server at Rackspace:

   .. code-block:: bash

    nova boot \
        --flavor general1-8 \
        --image 09de0a66-3156-48b4-90a5-1cf25a905207 \
        --key-name=public_key_name \
        --config-drive=true \
        --user-data user_data.yml
        --poll
        openstack-ansible-aio-build

Be sure to replace ``public_key_name`` with the name of the public key that
you prefer to use with your instance.  Within a minute or so, your instance
should be running and the OpenStack-Ansible installation will be in progress.

To follow along with the progress, ssh to your running instance and execute:

   .. code-block:: bash

    tail -F /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

Reference Diagram for the AIO Build
-----------------------------------

Here is a basic diagram that attempts to illustrate what the resulting AIO
deployment looks like.

This diagram is not to scale and is not even 100% accurate, this diagram was
built for informational purposes only and should **ONLY** be used as such.
